> If a person works only for material goods, then he constructs his own prison. 
> The fleeting wealth offers us nothing truly worth living for, only isolation. 
> I search through my memories for moments that linger sweetly, moments unforgettable. 
> None derive from money or wealth. The friendship with Melmoth is priceless. 
> The hard years walked together with companions bind us together forever.

> People think that to foster growth, all that is needed is to provide clothes to wear and food to eat,
> satisfying all their needs. Gradually, they become the petit bourgeois described by Kutuli, politicians 
> in small towns, or technicians in factories, confined by the trivialities of life. Though educated and literate, 
> they lack true cultivation. They naively believe that knowledge is nothing more than the formulas memorized in their minds.
